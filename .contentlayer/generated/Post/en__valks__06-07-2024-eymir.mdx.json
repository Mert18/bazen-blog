People who have never tried to transcend themselves, who have never even thought about it, and who have always looked down on what is different. If they are happy with us, we need to rethink what we are doing; if we are happier, then there is no problem.\n</Paragraph>\n\n<Paragraph>\n    Seeing oneself as superior by belittling others. Many choose this path. But this path leads nowhere but loneliness and sorrow. Those who belittle others to elevate themselves live by running away from their own shortcomings.\n</Paragraph>\n\n<BlogImage source={\"https://bazen.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/fotoraf/IMG_20240706_173833.jpg\"} description={\"Eymir Gölü yürüyüş yolundan bir manzara.\"} />\n\n<Paragraph>\n    This is a place beautiful enough to be worth spending a few hours on the road when you only have free time on the weekend. With a long enough walking route, enough trees, enough wildlife, and enough visitors, it's one of the rare places that hasn't been ruined yet for me. On the walking route on one side of the lake, there is no shade, which makes it the best part of the route. Since I saw a snake in this part last week, I was nervous while walking, but those who love the rose must endure its thorns. Those who don't love people must endure the snake.\n</Paragraph>\n\n<Paragraph>\n    It's not really about not liking; it's the many things that could be but aren't that bother me. It saddens me that two different people, who have been in different places for 24 years, raised by different families, and talked to different people, can be so the SAME. When you know the next question, you can't pretend to be surprised. If you can't learn something new from a person, you don't want to talk either. My intention is not to belittle anyone. I can't say I look very different from the outside. My problem is with the unbreakable ice. I wish we could be comfortable with people we don't know, everything scares us. When we're even hesitant to say 'good morning' to people at our new job, how can we learn that person's purpose in life? Is our hesitation about stealing people's time? We actually know that no one's time is that valuable.\n</Paragraph>\n\n\n<Quote from=\"Küçük Prens\">\n    Grown-ups love numbers. Suppose you tell them about a new friend you've made; they won't ask the essential questions. They won't even ask what their voice sounds like, what games they like, or if they collect butterflies. Instead, they'll ask, \"How old are they?\" \"How many siblings do they have?\" \"How much do they weigh?\" \"How much does their father earn?\" They think they know the person with this kind of information. If you say, \"I saw a beautiful house with red tiles. There were flower pots in the windows and doves on the roof.\" They can't picture this house. But if you say, \"I saw a house worth a hundred thousand liras,\" they'll immediately exclaim, \"Oh, what a beautiful house!\"\n</Quote>\n\n<BlogImage source={\"https://bazen.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/fotoraf/IMG_20240706_172715.jpg\"} description={\"Demir attım yalnızlığa, bir hasret denizinde...\"} />\n\n<Paragraph>\n    Since the road to Eymir is long, I glanced through the book 'The Society of the Spectacle.' These two sentences I read there kept running through my mind all day:\n</Paragraph>\n\n<Quote>\n    The entire life of societies in which modern production conditions prevail appears as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.\n</Quote>\n\n<Paragraph>\n    Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation. Doesn't it bother you too that we live copied lives despite so many possibilities? While the internet was created to bring us together, didn't it create a prototype?\n</Paragraph>\n\n<Paragraph>\n    Our desires shape us, and we don't know what we want because we never asked ourselves. We asked the internet what we want. We want what everyone else wants. We want to go where everyone else is going. We want to earn as much as everyone else is earning. We work harder just to catch up with those who earn more than us. At the end of our lives, we will show each other the material things we accumulated and then throw them off a cliff.\n</Paragraph>\n\n<BlogImage source={\"https://bazen.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/fotoraf/IMG_20240706_160403.jpg\"} description={\"Paper Flower.\"} />\n\n<Paragraph>\n    Someone must have thought I was looking for money because I was walking with my head down. I'm looking for flowers. I met a paperflower. I could have been just one of the hundreds of people passing by it today. Despite people around me, I stopped and took a photo of this tiny wonder, as small as my fingernail.\n</Paragraph>\n\n<Paragraph>\n    I enjoy when the sky completely clouds over from time to time. It's 4 PM. It's not as hot as it was two weeks ago. While thinking I hope I encounter a snake again, I heard a crow's call that I hadn't heard before. If you're 100% sure the sound you heard was a crow, there's a high chance it's a Hooded Crow. I've never heard a crow that sounds so much like a crow before. Crows turned out to be more skittish than I thought; I could only take the unclear photo below.\n</Paragraph>\n\n<BlogImage source={\"https://bazen.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/fotoraf/IMG_20240706_154642.jpg\"} description={\"Hooded Crow.\"} />\n\n<Paragraph>\n    Yes, at the end of our lives, we will show each other the material things we accumulated and then throw them off a cliff. Will the spiritual things we accumulated be important then? No answer. Should I spend time with my loved ones then? No answer. Should I work hard for years and die in America instead of Turkey? No answer.\n\n    <br />\n\n    When I first stepped away from this race and realized that people who exert far less effort than me and are poorer both materially and spiritually are happier than me, I declared my withdrawal from this fake race. I accepted that life includes sadness, sorrow, and ruin, and I admitted to myself that I found joy in them too. I decided that peace is better than material wealth, speaking is better than silence, and the outside is better than home. And when people asked me for advice, I remembered this old Turkish Folk Song lyric: \n</Paragraph>\n\n<Quote>\n    I came to reform this world, but later I saw my own essence in the midst of it.\n</Quote>",
